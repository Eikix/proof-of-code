# :rocket: Hello! Welcome to this small EVM-chain to EVM-chain Bridge POC! :sparkles:

This repo was used as a part of the Proof-of-code #2 talk, on June 2022 in Paris.

What you'll find there:
- A small solidity sample code to implement a cross-chain bridge.
- A Javascript script used to listen to blockchain events and relay information (e.g. bridge requests) between chains.

The .env file is not included, but refer to the `.env.example` file to find all the variables you need.
My advice, get a free tier on Alchemy or Infura for the websocket API Key, for the Private Key (PK), you'll find it in your EVM wallet's advanced parameter.

Cheers :))!
